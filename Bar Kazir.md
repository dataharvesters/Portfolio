### Hello and welcome to my Portfolio!

I'm Bar, a Data Analyst committed to turning raw, chaotic data into **actionable business insights**.

My career is founded on operational excellence and a rigorous, detail-oriented approach. I use this discipline to manage complex datasets, ensuring the integrity and reliability of every analysis I deliver. My goal is to bridge the gap between data and strategy.

#### My Focus & Expertise:

This portfolio showcases projects centered on four key areas:

* **Data Transformation:** Cleaning, restructuring, and preparing messy data for analysis using robust pipelines.
* **Insight Generation:** Applying statistical methods and visualization to uncover trends, anomalies, and key drivers.
* **Problem Solving:** Using data-driven narratives to answer complex business questions and recommend strategic next steps.
* **Automation & Process Engineering:** Building scripts and tools to eliminate friction and maximize output.


I primarily leverage **Python** (Pandas, NumPy), **SQL** for database querying, **Data Visualization** tools (PBI, Tableau) and AI ttols (Gemini, NotebookLM, AI agents). 

I invite you to check out my pinned repositories below. They demonstrate my full workflow, from data extraction to final visualization.

**Let's connect:** I'm interested in opportunities where deep data analysis and operational rigor are valued.
